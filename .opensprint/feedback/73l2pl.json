For each failure, diagnose the root cause (broken implementation, stale fixture, flaky assertion, missing dependency, etc.) and apply the minimal correct fix. Acceptance criteria: (1) `npm test` exits 0 with no failures, (2) no tests are skipped or deleted to achieve a pass, (3) each fix is committed with a message referencing the test file and failure reason.",
