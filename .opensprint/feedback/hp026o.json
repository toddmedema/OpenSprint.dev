Instead, display a loading spinner in its place until the initial data fetch completes.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- While the page/component is in a loading state (initial fetch in progress), the agent status indicator area in the top-right renders a compact loading spinner instead of the 'No agents running' message.\n- Once data has loaded, the indicator displays the correct state ('No agents running' if idle, or the active agent info if running).\n- The spinner matches the existing design system's loading indicator style.\n- No layout shift occurs when transitioning from spinner to the loaded indicator.",
