Currently, clicking 'Discuss' with the sidebar closed has no visible effect.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- When the chat sidebar is closed and the user clicks 'Discuss' on any PRD section, the sidebar opens automatically.\n- After opening, the conversation is focused on the clicked section (same behavior as when the sidebar is already open).\n- If the sidebar is already open, existing behavior is unchanged.\n- No flicker or layout jump when the sidebar opens from a Discuss click.",
