      "content": "OpenSprint is a web application that guides users through the complete software development lifecycle using AI agents. It provides a structured, five-phase workflow — **SPEED**: Sketch, Plan, Execute, Evaluate, and Deliver — that transforms high-level product ideas into working software with minimal manual intervention.\n\nThe platform pairs a browser-based interface with a background agent CLI, enabling AI to autonomously execute development tasks while keeping the user in control of strategy and direction. The core philosophy is that humans should focus on _what_ to build and _why_, while AI handles _how_ to build it.\n\nOpenSprint supports multiple agent backends (Claude, Cursor, and custom CLI agents), comprehensive automated testing including end-to-end and integration tests, configurable human-in-the-loop thresholds, and full offline operation for users with local agent setups.",

      "content": "Building software with AI today is fragmented and unstructured. Developers use AI coding assistants for individual tasks, but there is no cohesive system that manages the full journey from idea to deployed product. This leads to several persistent problems:\n\n- **Lack of architectural coherence:** AI-generated code often lacks a unified vision because each prompt is handled in isolation, without awareness of the broader system design.\n- **No dependency tracking:** When building features in parallel, there is no mechanism to ensure that work on one feature accounts for dependencies on another.\n- **Manual orchestration overhead:** Users spend significant time managing prompts, context windows, and task sequencing rather than focusing on product decisions.\n- **No feedback loop:** There is no structured way to validate completed work and feed findings back into the development process.\n\nOpenSprint solves these problems by providing an end-to-end platform that maintains context across the entire lifecycle and automates the orchestration of AI development agents.",

      "content": "### The Product-Minded Founder\n\nA non-technical founder with a clear product vision who wants to build an MVP without hiring a development team. They understand what they want to build but need AI to handle the engineering. They value speed, clear communication about what is being built, and the ability to provide feedback without writing code.\n\n### The Solo Developer\n\nAn experienced developer who wants to multiply their output. They can code but want to delegate routine implementation to AI while focusing on architecture and product decisions. They value transparency into what the AI is doing, the ability to intervene when needed, and high-quality code output.\n\n### The Agency / Consultancy\n\nA small team that builds software for clients. They need to move quickly from client requirements to working software, maintain multiple projects simultaneously, and provide clients with visibility into progress. They value the structured workflow for client communication and the ability to run multiple projects in parallel.",
