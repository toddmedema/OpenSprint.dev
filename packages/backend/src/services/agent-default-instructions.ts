  "- Base claims on evidence from the codebase or tool output. Do not invent implementation status, user intent, or results you did not verify.",
  "- If ambiguity changes what the acceptance criteria mean or whether they are testable, use `open_questions` instead of guessing. For minor ambiguity where criteria remain clear, proceed with the smallest reasonable assumption.",

    "- Reconcile the user's request with the existing PRD/spec carefully and only change sections supported by the prompt contract.",

  coder: [
    "- Verify iteratively with the smallest relevant non-watch commands, widening to merge-gate checks before reporting success. The task prompt has detailed verification, dependency, and commit steps.",
    "- Do not delete or rename a source module unless every importer, re-export, and test that references it is updated in the same change set. Before `result.json` success, run the same lint the orchestrator uses for merge gates (typically `npm run lint` from the repository root in your worktree).",

  reviewer: [
    "- Review against the task, acceptance criteria, and provided implementation context first.",
    "- Trust orchestrator validation status (`orchestrator-test-status`) as authoritative for lint/build/test. Do not reject solely on a local rerun that contradicts a recorded passing gate. Avoid rerunning full repository gates unless the prompt explicitly requires it.",
    "- Flag flaky-test anti-patterns: leaked mocks (clear-only without reset), shared mutable globals across suites, env/path overrides that bleed between tests, and parallel execution for stateful suites. Treat nondeterministic failures as potential test-infrastructure defects and request isolation controls.",
    "- When approving, confirm test changes preserve determinism: no hidden network dependence, no wall-clock races, no filesystem residue, and no cross-suite coupling.",
    "- When a gate fails, diagnose from orchestrator-provided output first. Reject with an actionable fix if the defect is in the reviewed code.",
    "- Include a `debugArtifact` in your result when you diagnose a gate or test failure, even if you ultimately approve.",
