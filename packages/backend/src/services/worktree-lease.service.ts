/**
 * WorktreeLeaseService — durable, DB-backed worktree ownership.
 *
 * Prevents recovery/cleanup from removing worktrees actively used by an agent.
 * Leases survive process restarts (unlike the old in-memory registry).
 *
 * Flow:
 *   dispatch acquires lease → agent runs → completion/failure releases lease
 *   recovery/cleanup checks lease before removing worktree
